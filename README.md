# Synergy
_One device at one time_

## Motivation
This is made for the project in the course Network Programming in BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in the fall of 2017. The idea was always in the back of my head but I couldn't find the time/motivation to begin with it.

## Summary
    The project aims to create a way for **Android** phones and **GNU/Linux**
    laptops to connect and communicate with each other on a local area network,
    be it wired or wireless.

    The project is expected to send all Android notifications to the laptop and
    all laptop notifications to the phone. The project can also be extended to
    provide support to get tty access on a phone that is connected to the
    laptop providing (virtually) unlimited functionality.
