# Synergy
_One device at one time_

## Motivation
This is made for the project in the course Network Programming in BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in the fall of 2017. The idea was always in the back of my head but I couldn't find the time/motivation to begin with it.

## Summary
The project aims to make it easier to pick up calls when working on a laptop with the phone kept some place else. If the phone is connected to the laptop with a local area network, then the user can pick up calls and talk via the speakers and mic of the laptop itself, without the need to even touch the phone.
